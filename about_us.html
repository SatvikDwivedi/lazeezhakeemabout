    "Lazeez Hakeem And My <br> Grandfather's Hard Work".
</h1>
<br>
<p class="text-center text-white">My grandfather "Mr. Hakimuddin Saheb" was of high thinking, hardworking and caring personality who laid the foundation for the upbringing of their coming generations by his hard work with the promise that all those people would also do their work with full hard work and dedication. My grandfather came to Bhopal in 1968 with his father "Tayyab Ali Sahab". <br> <br> After coming to Bhopal, he did a job at Satpura Vindhyachal Bhavan as window glass installer. Apart from this, after some time, he started selling tea with his two brothers in that area by the end of 1969. <br><br>
    After The Vindhyachal Satpura Bhavan was built, the contractors and laborers started migrating from here to build a new project i .e Tatyatop Nagar (new market), bence, grandfather and his brothers also migrated to new market. From here, Grandfather decided to do business instead of job and start selling snacks and tea from a small shop. This was just the beginning of a long journey including the passion for quality food, hard work and dedication towards work. <br><br> After some time new market was built, it laid the foundation of new Bhopal. Grandfather took a shop here from nagar nigam and opened a restaurant, which was named "Hakeem Hotel" on his first name. The name of the restaurant was given by his mother "Mariyam Bai Sahiba". </p>

    <p class="text-white text-center">
    My grandfather and his two younger brothers "Akhtar Hussain Sahab" and "Shabbir Hussain Sahab" worked together with all their energy, time and dedication to make "Hakeem Hotel" reach new heights. Due to that, coming generations got their golden future. My great-grandmother nurtured my father, uncle and his cousins and they all had a well rounded childhood. <br> <br> After few years passed, my father and uncles started lending their hands in family business and opened various branches, by the grace of god everything was going well. The time when came outsiders started exploiting the brand value of Hakeem and all family members were in their comfort zone, nobody was bothered by the fact that some people are trying to damage the name their ancestors have built throughout their life. <br> <br> </p>

        My name is Mohammad Husain. I am part of the cultural, discipline family and am blessed to have them. My school life was full of mischievous and energetic activities, be it studies or exams, my behavior remained same all the time, because of these mischiefs, whenever there was a PTM, the teacher used to say "Larka intelligent hai lekin padhta nhi hai". And my mother used to reply with a smile "Haan me janti hu”. So, it was always a win-win situation for me.

    I recently graduated from Jagran Lakecity University, Bhopal, in Hospitality and hotel administration. During my college practicals, there was a lot of competition between me and comrades. However, in my second semester I got an opportunity to compete in a national level cooking competition where I represented my college, it held in Bangaluru International Exibition Center, Bangalore, I prepared a scrumptious traditional biryani whose recipe was given by my Grandfather to my father and he taught me. So, I start this competition with their blessings and won that, received a gold medal with certificate. You won't believe because of that, I was invited as a Delegate in 7th Chef Summit held in Delhi in 2019. <br><br>

        CONCLUSION

</div>

<div>
    <p class="text-white">
        I would like to clarify here that whatever I have said is based on my knowledge, I have gathered this information from my grandparents, parents and my own observation. It reflects my family and their work order. I am not saying that anyone else (who is associated with the Hakeem name) in this conversation is a stranger to the "Hakeem" brand. They also have their own rights, but everyone's jurisdiction is different.

    <p class="text-white">
        You would be aware of the fact that running an established brand as per its brand value requires a lot of skill. The person leading it has a lot of time experience. Buying the right raw materials for a restaurant brand is a big deal. At all times, care has to be taken that the reputation of the brand is not harmed for any reason, whatsoever. Whereas, people who are copying are not required to maintain any kind of standard. I would like to request all of you to differentiate between authentic and fake restaurants in the market according to your conscience and do not promote them.
